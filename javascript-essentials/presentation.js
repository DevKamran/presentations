 *   - Dynamically typed
 *   - Everything is an object... even primitives
 *   - Functions are "first-class" objects
 *   - Multi-paradigm language
 *      - Object oriented (prototype)
 *      - Imperative (procedural)
 *      - Functional (lambda)

/**
 * Objects in JavaScript
 *
 *  - An object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs.
 */
























/**
 * Functions in JavaScript
 *
 *  - Functions are first-class objects.
 *  - Functions can be anonymous.
 *  - Functions can be "self-executing"
 *  - Functions encapsulate and capture context.
 *  - Closures
 *  - Module pattern

/**
 * Understanding 'this'
 *
 *  - http://ryanmorr.com/understanding-scope-and-context-in-javascript/
 *  - http://www.quirksmode.org/js/this.html
 *
 *  - Difference between context and scope.
 *  - 'new' objects create context
 *  - 'this' is assigned to the object instance that 'invokes' a method.
 *  - You can bind context with 'bind'
 *  - You can call a method with context using 'call' or 'apply'
 */
























/**
 * Object Oriented JavaScript
 *
 * Understanding the 'prototype'
 *
 *  - The prototype serves as the 'blueprint' for object instances.
 *  - Each object instance "inherits" the prototype.
 *  - You can create jQuery plugins using jQuery.fn and point to your class.
 *  - Module Classes
