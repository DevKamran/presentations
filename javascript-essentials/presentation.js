/**
 * Objects in JavaScript
 *

/**
 * Functions in JavaScript
 *
 *  - Functions are "first-class" objects.
 *  - Functions can be anonymous.
 *  - Functions can be "self-executing"
 *  - Functions encapsulate and capture scope.
 *  - Closures
 *  - Module Pattern
 *  - Common.JS Module Pattern

/**
 * Understanding 'this'
 *
 *  - http://bit.ly/VHXAYB
 *  - http://bit.ly/1SourKC
 *
 *  - Difference between scope and context.
 *  - 'new' objects create context
 *  - 'this' is assigned to the object instance that 'invokes' a method.
 *  - You can bind context with 'bind'
 *  - You can call a method with context using 'call' or 'apply'
 */























/**
 * Object Oriented JavaScript
 *
 * Understanding the 'prototype'
 *
 *  - The prototype serves as the 'blueprint' for object instances.
 *  - Each object instance "inherits" the prototype.
 *  - You can create jQuery plugins using jQuery.fn and point to your class.
 *  - "Module Classes" combine Module pattern with OOP pattern.
